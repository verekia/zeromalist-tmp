            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Traveling lightweight is great for mobility, reduces the risks for losing stuff, and saves time when packing.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Having everything you need in one backpack allows you to skip checking baggages at the airport, and waiting for them at baggage claim. It also lets you start visiting right out the airport without having to drop off a cumbersome suitcase at the hotel / Airbnb first.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Check the weather beforehand, so you don't take any unnecessary clothes. Shave, put on your nail polish, or whatever it is that you do, right before leaving instead of bringing stuff with you. And just generally prepare your bag with a minimalist mindset with only things you will absolutely need. Always pick Airbnb places that provide bed sheets and towels, or bring a microfiber towel.</p>
