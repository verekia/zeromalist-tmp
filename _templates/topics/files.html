            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Organized files increase your efficiency. Backed up files protects your work and important personal data.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: The ability to lose / break / reformat / upgrade / get your computer stolen knowing that you haven't lost a single file.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Have all your important files on Dropbox / Drive. Do an offline backup of your entire Dropbox / Drive once a month in case an internal flaw on their system deletes your files (both on their server and on your main computer). You can for instance have an other user account on your computer just to have a separate instance of Dropbox / Drive syncing to a custom folder located on a large capacity external hard drive.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Small internal hard drives, particularly SSDs can't necessarily handle all the data you own, so you can't always have your entire Dropbox / Drive synced locally in your main computer user account.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: Selective sync. Only keep in your main computer user account the folder and files you actually need on a daily basis. Upload small files directly via the web interface. For bigger files, have an Upload folder in your Dropbox / Drive for the transfer, then move the file to an online-only folder via the web interface to make it disappear from your computer.</p>
