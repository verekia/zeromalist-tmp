            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: An empty desktop is liberating and inspiring. An <a target="_blank" href="img/downloads.png">empty Download folder</a> ensures everything else is backed up on Dropbox / Drive. </p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Remove all icons and shortcuts from your desktop. On Mac, if you show hidden files, you'll need to deactivate the Desktop completely using a command line to hide .DS_Store and such files. You then have a beautiful space to pick a great wallpaper. I personally use a <a target="_blank" href="img/desktop.png">simple black wood one</a>, which looks very sleek and zen. Keep your launchbar to the very minimum as well. Treat your Downloads folder like a to-do list. Any file there must be treated like a normal task. You usually either trash it or save it online. Keeping your Trash empty is also nice and soothing.</p>
