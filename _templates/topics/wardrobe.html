            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Aim for <a href="img/clothes.jpg" target="_blank">1 model per type of clothes, times 7</a>. Having this sort of uniform makes your life so much simpler. It basically engineers clothing to make it functional and optimal.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Reduces the time spent picking clothes down to 3 seconds - you just grab the first item of each pile and you're done. You'll never wonder what to wear ever again, and it saves tons of space. If you lose or get your luggage stolen while traveling, you'll reconstitute your wardrobe very easily.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Get 7 of the same best pairs of socks, boxers, and shirts, 2 of the same best pants, 1 or 2 of the best sweaters, 1 pair of the best shorts, and 1 pair of the best shoes. Have a bag of "occasional clothes" like flip-flops, a swimming suit, a suit shirt and jacket, sunglasses, etc., but keep these to the very minimum. Make sure you get fitted pants and shorts to not need a belt (it saves time every single day, and makes airport security checks smoother and less awkward).</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: It's obviously very repetitive.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: You probably won't mind wearing the same model of underwear, pants, or shoes every day, but having a few different (but similar) shirts is pretty efficient at making you feel like you're wearing a different outfit.</p>
