            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Living very close to your workplace, or working from home, is an incredible increase in quality of life for those who are used to commute for more than an hour per day.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: No need for a car (if there is good public transportation in your area), which saves tons of money and worries.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Look for an apartment that is close to your workplace (within walking distance, ideally, but a quick bus or train trip is fine), gives you access to all the local businesses you need, particularly a groceries store, and make sure you can reach major train stations and the airport relatively easily from there. Once you've found the perfect location, a public transportation card, a few Uber rides, and comfortable shoes to walk around is all you need!</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Exceptional medium-distance trips become trickier, even though I consider the everyday life comfort to be more important.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: You can rent a car, or have a long and painful public transportation trip once in awhile. If it's a group trip, some of your friends will probably be fine with taking you with them.</p>
