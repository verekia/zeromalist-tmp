            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Wearing only black and white makes your life simpler. It always goes well. Not mixing black with black-ish clothes, and white with white-ish clothes, will also make these last longer. If that's your thing, you can go hardcore and only wear black, but I personally like contrast a lot, so I'll stick to black and white for the moment.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: No need to do laundry for colors, which actually saves quite some time, I'd say half an hour per week.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Well obviously, to many people, this is depressing as hell. Being an ex-metalhead, it doesn't bother me to wear a lot of black, but it would definitely be an issue for people who like to wear joyful clothes, or people who care about their looks in general.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: I wear colorful bracelets, which make the overall look more friendly and fun. Shoes or shoelaces can be colorful to compensate as well.</p>
