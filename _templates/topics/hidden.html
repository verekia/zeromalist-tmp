            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Containers are your enemy. Boxes, drawers, closets, hidden spaces like under your bed, trick you into thinking your mess is tidy by hiding it. I prefer keeping most things I own somewhat visible for better control. It forces me to reconsider getting rid of unused junk more often.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Since I barely use storage, I don't need to buy much of it, so it saves money and space. Also, being able to estimate the volume of things you own in a glimpse makes it easier to plan when moving. No surprises like a forgotten big box in the closet.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: The general rule of thumb is to avoid putting things in places that are difficult to see. Avoid the highest shelves that require a chair to reach, or putting items behind others, making them invisible and forgettable. If you thoroughly decluttered your home, you shouldn't have much left, so the visual pollution should be pretty minimal.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Bonus</span>: An extension to this approach of preferring content over containers is to apply it to smaller things as well. Food, office supplies, hardware items... basically everything comes wrapped in plastic or in a box. Ask yourself if you need all these containers or if the content is just enough.</p>
