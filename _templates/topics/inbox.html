            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Not forgetting tasks, getting things done quick, eliminating mental reminder loops like "oh crap, I forgot again that I have to do this thing". It reduces your stress significantly.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Knowing you have absolutely nothing to take care of at the moment is extremely liberating and will free your mind to do things that matter.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Read about the GTD workflow and similar strategies, and apply them with modern tools. For emails and to-do lists, I highly recommend Inbox by Gmail. It has been conceived with inbox zero in mind, integrates reminders, and lets you postpone emails. A must-have. Here are the slides of a presentation I gave about going <a target="_blank" href="http://verekia.com/slides/todo-zero">from regular GTD to to-do zero</a>.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Addictive. An empty inbox or to-do list usually means you've done the urgent things, but not necessarily important things. Don't go too crazy with task-killing and keep an eye on the most important things as well.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: If an undone task bugs you and prevents you from working on something important, plan a task-killing session later and postpone it to buffer it with other tasks.</p>
