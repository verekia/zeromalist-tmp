            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: <a target="_blank" href="img/facebook-feed.png">Empty homepage feeds</a> will save you huge amounts of time by making Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat completely pointless to look at.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Depends on your level of addiction, but in my case it probably saves something like than 10 hours per week. That is literally 22 days per year!</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: <em>Unfollow</em> all of your friends on Facebook, but turn on notifications for the truly important ones (except if they're spammy). This way when you open Facebook you'll immediately see if they posted something, and since your homepage feed is empty, there is really nothing else to do there, so you will leave immediately. For Twitter and Instagram, just unfollow everyone. For Snapchat, make your account public and remove all the friends that are not truly your close friends. This way everyone can still send you things, but you won't be tempted by watching uninteresting stories.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Following 0 people will make you look like a total selfish jerk who is not interested in what other people have to say. That's particularly true for businesses.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: Find and follow 10 people who have zero posts. That will keep your feed empty. If people click on your followings and see weird accounts, that's not too much of a big deal. If some of your friends find out you don't follow them anymore, just say the truth. Explain you unfollowed everyone, not just them, because you need to spend less time on these sites.</p>
