            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Digitizing and accessing your documents online is a huge quality of life improvement compared to keeping tons of them at home. Paper can burn, get stained, ripped, or lost, is heavy and cumbersome, and a hassle to deal with in general.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Retrieving any document or personal information in a few seconds, from any computer or phone. Administrative tasks that require paperwork become a walk in the park.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Get a small scanner if you don't have one already, scan all of your documents, and organize them nicely in your Dropbox / Drive folder. Once everything is backed up, you can throw away the documents that can get re-printed easily, but keep the original important ones (payslips, taxes, social security, contracts with original signatures, documents with complex watermarks...). Put those in a nice well-organized binder.</p>
