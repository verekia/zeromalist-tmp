            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Smartphones are a huge source of distraction that needs to be eliminated. Save huge amounts of time by making them less tempting and disruptive.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Just like with <em>Feeds Zero</em> above, some people can literally save dozens of days per year by being less tempted to waste time on their phone. And you will get work done faster and more efficiently if you don't get interrupted by notifications.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: On Android, remove all icons from the home screen, and even remove some from the bottom launchbar if you don't use them more than 5 times a day. I personally only have Chrome and Inbox by Gmail, which I both open probably more than 10 times a day, and <a target="_blank" href="img/phone-home.png">that's it</a>. For anything else, I open the app drawer to find the app, which takes less than a second. You should obviously also remove all the junk apps that you don't use, and even <em>Disable</em> the stock apps that you can't uninstall, to have a <a target="_blank" href="img/phone-apps.png">clean minimal app drawer</a> with easy to find apps. Turn off as many push notifications as possible too. Your phone now looks super sleek, but boring and not fun, to dissuade you from wasting time on it.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Bonus</span>: Keep a clean install checklist, like for <em>Computer Zero</em> below.</p>
