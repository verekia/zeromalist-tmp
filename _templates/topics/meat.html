        <p>I am a vegetarian. I love the taste of meat, but I don't like killing animals for 2 minutes of pleasure, and I'd rather not have heart diseases or some form of cancer that comes from consuming meat. I would go vegan if my country – France – wasn't so dairy-oriented. I also drink Joylent (Soylent for Europe) every other day.</p>
