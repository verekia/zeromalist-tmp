            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Synthetic sportswear fabric is softer, breathes better than cotton, dries almost instantly, and I personally think it looks futuristic and cool. Plain tennis polo shirts can look elegant like a shirt. Synthetic fabric gets less moldy than cotton in humid environments.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: No need to iron it, no need to use fabric softener. Wearing sportswear also makes you seem more like a sport guy on his way to the gym, which looks tougher and is less inviting for people who would want to mess with you.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Go to your local sportswear store and buy a bunch of synthetic fabric shirts, pants, and whatever you'll need. I ordered all my underwear on Amazon, which makes it very easy to replace some.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Potential problem</span>: It's unclear whether wearing synthetic fabric every day on the long run has negative effects on your skin or not. My guess is that if it's bad, it probably won't be <em>too</em> bad. I suppose some people's skin might not tolerate well some types of synthetic fabric.</p>
