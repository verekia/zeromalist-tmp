            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Walking with the bare minimum: phone, keys, and tiny wallet feels good, and you lose less things if you lose your wallet or get it stolen. It also doesn't stretch your pants pockets.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Take out all those useless cards from your wallet, get a tiny one, with just your ID, debit card, public transport card if applicable, your health insurance card if applicable, and a $20 or 20â‚¬ bill just in case. Keep all your coins in a separate pouch or jar somewhere home, and use them or give them away as often as possible. Only keep your home keys, mailbox keys, and possibly car keys on your keychain. <a target="_blank" href="img/wallet.jpg">Here is my wallet and keys</a>, connected by a tiny carabiner to easily add or remove keys (much better than a ring!).</p>
