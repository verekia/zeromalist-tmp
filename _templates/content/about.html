            <!-- 
                Google Docs Zero: Cloud-only files are a liability if your account gets compromised. Prefer TXT/MD files, or Word / Excel if necessary.
                Things-I-liked / Forgotten Favourites Zero: Keeping lists for favorite artists and songs, favorite shows, books, video games, etc. Just the names because everything is available online once you have the name.
                Kitchen Zero: 1 of everything if alone, 2 of everything if couple. If you're having people over, get some plastic or eco-friendly dishes.
                Web Hosting Zero: Jekyll, or custom build script. Also, if like me, you buy a lot of domain names, make sure you declutter once in awhile. Combined, these things end up costing a bunch.
                News Zero: information diet
