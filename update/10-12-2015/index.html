<h2 class="h2 text-center text-no-bold title-decoration">10-12-2015 Update</h2>

        <div id="documents" class="section-60">
            <div class="clearfix topic-header">
                <h3 class="primary float-left">Paper Documents Zero</h3>
                <div class="side-info float-right ml-12"><span class="badge">new</span>10-12-2015</div>
            </div>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Digitizing and accessing your documents online is a huge improvement in quality of life, compared to keeping tons of them at home. Paper can burn, get stained, ripped, lost, is heavy and cumbersome, and a hassle to deal with in general.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Retrieving any document or personal information in a few seconds, from any computer or phone. Administrative tasks that require paperwork become a walk in the park.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Get a small scanner if you don't have one already, scan all of your documents, and organize them nicely in your Dropbox / Drive folder. Once everything is backed up, you can throw away the documents that can get re-printed easily, but keep the original important ones (payslips, taxes, social security, contracts with original signatures, documents with complex watermarks...). Put those in a nice well-organized binder.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hidden" class="section-60">
            <div class="clearfix topic-header">
                <h3 class="primary float-left">Hidden Stuff Zero</h3>
                <div class="side-info float-right ml-12"><span class="badge">new</span>10-12-2015</div>
            </div>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Containers are your enemy. Boxes, drawers, closets, hidden spaces like under your bed, trick you into thinking your mess is tidy by hiding it. I prefer keeping most things I own somewhat visible for better control. It forces me to reconsider getting rid of unused junk more often.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Since I barely use storage, I don't need to buy much of it, so it saves money and space. Also, being able to estimate the volume of things you own in a glimpse makes it easier to plan when moving. No surprises like a forgotten big box in the closet.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: The general rule of thumb is to avoid putting things in places that are difficult to see. Avoid the highest shelves that require a chair to reach, or putting items behind others, making them invisible and forgettable. If you thoroughly decluttered your home, you shouldn't have much left, so the visual pollution should be pretty minimal.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Bonus</span>: An extension to this approach of preferring content over containers is to apply it to smaller things as well. Overly-packaged food, office supplies, hardware items... basically everything comes wrapped in plastic or in a box. Ask yourself if you need the container or if the content is enough.</p>

        <div id="commute" class="section-60">
            <div class="clearfix topic-header">
                <h3 class="primary float-left">Commute Zero</h3>
                <div class="side-info float-right ml-12"><span class="badge">new</span>09-26-2015</div>
            </div>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Living very close to your workplace, or working from home, is an incredible increase in quality of life for those who are used to commuting for more than an hour per day.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: No need for a car (if there is good public transportation in your area), which saves tons of money and worries.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Look for an apartment that is close to your workplace (within walking distance, ideally, but a quick bus or train trip is fine), gives you access to all the local businesses you need, particularly a grocery store, and lets you reach major train stations and an airport relatively easily. Once you've found the perfect location, a public transportation card, a few Uber rides, and comfortable shoes to walk around is all you need!</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Without a car, exceptional medium-distance trips become trickier, even though I consider the everyday life comfort to be more important.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: You can rent a car, or have a long and painful public transportation trip once in awhile. If it's a group trip, some of your friends will probably be fine with taking you with them.</p>
