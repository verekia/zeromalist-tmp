            <p class="intro">
                This manifesto documents minimalism guidelines I've been applying to my life. Embracing minimalism on different aspects of your life has plenty of benefits, like the peace of mind, knowing where things are, and being low-maintenance in general. If we were to evaluate how much of a minimalist you are, it could be anywhere from not at all to 100% minimal.

                By actually reaching zero (or 100%), you <em>unlock features</em>. These can be significant (like allowing you to rent your appartment on Airbnb) or minor (like not having to check-in any luggage at the airport).

        <div class="section-60">
            <h3 class="primary">Inbox Zero and Tasks Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Not forgetting tasks, getting things done quick, eliminating mental reminder loops like "oh crap, I forgot again I had to do this"</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Knowing you have absolutely nothing to take care of at the moment is extremely liberating and will free your mind to do things that matter.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Read about the GTD workflow and similar, and apply it with modern tools. For emails and todo lists I highly recommendent Inbox by Gmail, which has been conceived with inbox zero in mind, and which integrates reminders and lets you postpone emails from your inbox. A must-have.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Addictive. An empty inbox or todo list usually means you've done the urgent things, but not necessarily important things. Don't go too crazy with task killing and keep an eye on the most important things as well.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: If an undone task bugs you and prevents you from working on something important, plan a task-killing session later and postpone it to buffer it with other tasks.</p>
        </div>


        <div class="section-60">
        <h3 class="primary">Distractions Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Feeds zero:
Not following anyone on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. Follow 10 people who have zero posts to not seem like a jerk
Goal: Less wasted time</p>

            <h3 class="primary">Local Files Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Organized files increase your efficiency. Backed up files protects your work and important personal data.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: The ability to lose / break / reformat / get your computer stolen knowing that you haven't lost a single file. Being able to restore the exact state of your computer easily and fast.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Have all your important files on Dropbox / Drive. Have a back up offline server that syncs your Dropbox / Drive once a month in case an internal flaw on their system deletes your files (both on their server and on your main computer).</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Problem</span>: Small hard drives can't handle all the data you own, so you can't always have your entire Dropbox / Drive synced locally.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">Solution</span>: Selective sync. Only keep in your local Dropbox folder the files you actually need on a daily basis. Upload small files directly via the web interface. For bigger files, have an Upload folder in your Dropbox / Drive for the transfer, then move the file on the web interface.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="primary">Desktop and Downloads Zero</h3>

        <div class="section-60">
        <h3 class="primary">Home Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: A decluttered and tidy home feels great. It's easier to clean, you find your things instantly, it makes moving easier. It should feel like you're walking into a (good) Airbnb apartment, all clean and made for you to relax.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: If you're apartment is as clean and tidy as an Airbnb, well you can Airbnb it! When moving out, you should also try to have as few things as possible, so that everything can be moved in only one car trip and without movers.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: For every item of your house, ask yourself the following questions. Is it something you haven't used or wore in a year or more? Trash it, sell it, or give it. Is it something that you keep for memories but probably won't use or wear in the future? Take a picture of it and trash it, sell it, or give it. Pictures convey the same "aww" memories effect than the object itself, so as long as it's not a very important object, you're fine with just a photo of it. Is it something you use or wear often, or love so much that a photo wouldn't replace it? Keep it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-60">
        <h3 class="primary">Pockets and Wallet Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Walking with the bare minimum: phone, keys, and tiny wallet feels good, and you lose less things if you lose your wallet or get it stolen.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Take out all those useless cards from your wallet, get a tiny one, with just your ID, debit card, public transport card if applicable, your health insurance card if applicable, and a $20 or 20€ bill just in case. Keep all your coins in a separate pouch or jar somewhere home, and use them or give them away as often as possible. Only keep your home keys, mailbox keys, and possibly car keys on your keychain.</p>
        </div>

         <div class="section-60">
        <h3 class="primary">Luggage Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Traveling lightweight is great for mobility, reduces the risks for losing stuff, and saves time when packing.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature unlocked</span>: Having everything you need in one backpack allows you to skip checking baggages at the airport, and waiting for them at baggage claim. It also lets you start visiting right off the airport without having to drop off a cumbersome suitcase at the hotel / Airbnb first.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Check the weather beforehand, so you don't take any unnecessary clothes. Shave, put on nail polish, or whatever you do, right before leaving instead of bringing stuff with you. And just generally prepare your bag with a minimalist mindset with only things you will absolutely need. Always pick Airbnb places that provide bed sheets and towels, or bring a tiny microfiber towel.</p>

        <div class="section-60">
        <h3 class="primary">Clothes Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: 1 kind of boxers (Under Armour, synthetic, black)
1 kind of socks (Gore Wear Running, black). only 2 kind of laundry, black and white, synthetic fabric gets less moldy and makes you less sweaty. Dries faster after laundry. Keep clothes in a luggage instead of closet to always know how much stuff you have. Sportswear only. Can also look nice (Tennis clothes with polo neck). Have a place for "occasional stuff" > flip flops, swimming suit, suit jacket and shirt, etc. Never wonder what to wear. Also microfiber towels</p>

        <h2 class="h2 text-center text-no-bold title-decoration">Other Zeroes</h2>

        <div class="section-42">
        <p>These are my other personal Zeroes. They are not related to minimalism and more focused on lifestyle or health.</p>
        <h3 class="primary">Meat Zero</h3>
        <p>I am a vegetarian. I love the taste of meat, but I don't like killing animals for 2 minutes of pleasure, and I'd rather not have heart diseases or some form of cancer that comes from consuming meat. I would go vegan if my country – France – wasn't so dairy-oriented. I also drink Joylent (Soylent for Europe) every other day.</p>

        <h3 class="primary">Shampoo Zero</h3>
        <p>Also known as the "No Poo" method. I use baking soda or Ghassoul clay to wash my hair, and apple cider vinegar for conditioner. Basically, shampoos disrupt your hair's natural ability to clean itself, and using more natural products allow you to wash it less without it feeling dirty. A minimalist feature is that you don't need to bring shampoo if you travel for less than a week.</p>

        <h3 class="primary">Drugs Zero</h3>
        <p>I don't smoke cigarettes or cannabis, and don't take any recreational or harder drug. I drink alcohol when hanging out with friends, but don't get drunk like I used to do in high school or university. The reason for this is both avoiding wasted hangover days, and keeping my liver in good condition. I also prefer staying away from medical drugs, unless absolutely necessary.</p>
