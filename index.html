                This manifesto documents minimalism guidelines I've been applying to my life. Embracing minimalism on different aspects of your life has plenty of benefits, like the peace of mind, knowing where things are, and being low-maintenance in general. If we were to evaluate "how much of a minimalist" you are, it could be anywhere from not at all to 100% minimal.

                By actually reaching zero (or 100%), you unlock "features". These can be significant (like allowing you to rent your appartment on Airbnb) or minor (like not having to check-in any luggage at the airport).

            <h3 class="primary">Inbox Zero and Tasks Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Not forgetting tasks, getting things done quick, eliminating mental reminder loops like "oh crap, I forgot again I had to do this"</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature at zero</span>: Knowing you have absolutely nothing to take care of at the moment. Extremely liberating.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Read about the GTD workflow and such, apply it. For emails and todo lists I highly recommendent Inbox by Gmail, which has been conceived with inbox zero in mind, and which integrates reminders and lets you postpone emails right from your inbox. Must have for a minimalist.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Cons</span>: Addictive. An empty inbox or todo list usually means you've done the urgent things, but not necessarily important things. Don't go too crazy with task killing and keep an eye on the most important things as well.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">How to overcome it</span>: If an undone task bugs you and prevents you from working on something important, plan a task-killing session later and postpone it to buffer it with other tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3 class="primary">Local files zero</h3>
            <p class="pros">Organized files increase your efficiency. Backed up files protects your work and important personal data.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature">The ability to lose / break / reformat / get your computer stolen knowing that you haven't lost a single file. Being able to restore the exact state of your computer easily and fast.</p>
            <p class="howto">How to: Have all your important files on Dropbox / Drive. Have a back up offline server that syncs your Dropbox / Drive once a month in case an internal flaw on their system deletes your files (both on their server and on your main computer).</p>
            <p class="cons">Small hard drives can't handle all the data you own, so you can't always have your entire Dropbox / Drive synced locally.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome">Selective sync. Only keep in your local Dropbox folder the files you actually need on a daily basis. Upload small files directly via the web interface. For bugger files, have an Upload folder in your Dropbox / Drive for the transfer, then move the file on the web interface.</p>
