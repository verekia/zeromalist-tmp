            <p class="intro">
                This manifesto documents minimalism guidelines I've been applying to my life. Embracing minimalism on different aspects of your life has plenty of benefits, like the peace of mind, knowing where things are, and being low-maintenance in general. If we were to evaluate "how much of a minimalist" you are, it could be anywhere from not at all to 100% minimal.

                By actually reaching zero (or 100%), you unlock "features". These can be significant (like allowing you to rent your appartment on Airbnb) or minor (like not having to check-in any luggage at the airport).

        <div class="section-42">
            <h3 class="primary">Inbox Zero and Tasks Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Not forgetting tasks, getting things done quick, eliminating mental reminder loops like "oh crap, I forgot again I had to do this"</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature at zero</span>: Knowing you have absolutely nothing to take care of at the moment. Extremely liberating.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Read about the GTD workflow and such, apply it. For emails and todo lists I highly recommendent Inbox by Gmail, which has been conceived with inbox zero in mind, and which integrates reminders and lets you postpone emails right from your inbox. A must-have.</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Cons</span>: Addictive. An empty inbox or todo list usually means you've done the urgent things, but not necessarily important things. Don't go too crazy with task killing and keep an eye on the most important things as well.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">How to overcome it</span>: If an undone task bugs you and prevents you from working on something important, plan a task-killing session later and postpone it to buffer it with other tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-42">
            <h3 class="primary">Local Files Zero</h3>
            <p class="pros"><span class="bold">Pros</span>: Organized files increase your efficiency. Backed up files protects your work and important personal data.</p>
            <p class="zero-feature"><span class="bold">Feature at zero</span>:  The ability to lose / break / reformat / get your computer stolen knowing that you haven't lost a single file. Being able to restore the exact state of your computer easily and fast.</p>
            <p class="howto"><span class="bold">How to</span>: Have all your important files on Dropbox / Drive. Have a back up offline server that syncs your Dropbox / Drive once a month in case an internal flaw on their system deletes your files (both on their server and on your main computer).</p>
            <p class="cons"><span class="bold">Cons</span>: Small hard drives can't handle all the data you own, so you can't always have your entire Dropbox / Drive synced locally.</p>
            <p class="cons-overcome"><span class="bold">How to overcome it</span>: Selective sync. Only keep in your local Dropbox folder the files you actually need on a daily basis. Upload small files directly via the web interface. For bugger files, have an Upload folder in your Dropbox / Drive for the transfer, then move the file on the web interface.</p>

        <h3>Distractions zero</h3>

        <h3>Desktop and Downloads zero</h3>





        <h3>Phone zero</h3>
        <h3>Dropbox / Drive zero</h3>

        <h2 class="h2 text-center text-no-bold title-decoration">At Home</h2>

        <h3>Home zero</h3>
        <h3>Cotton zero</h3>
        <h3>Luggage zero</h3>


        <h2 class="h2 text-center text-no-bold title-decoration">Non-Minimalism Zeroes</h2>

        <div class="section-42">
        <p>These are my other personal Zeroes. They are not related to minimalism and more focused on lifestyle or health.</p>
        <h3 class="primary">Meat Zero</h3>
        <p>I am a vegetarian. I love the taste of meat, but I don't like killing animals for 2 minutes of pleasure, and I'd rather not have heart diseases or some form of cancer that comes from consuming meat. I would go vegan if my country – France – wasn't so dairy-oriented. I also drink Joylent (Soylent for Europe) every other day.</p>

        <h3 class="primary">Shampoo Zero</h3>
        <p>Also known as the "No Poo" method. I use baking soda or Ghassoul clay to wash my hair, and apple cider vinegar for conditioner. Basically, shampoos disrupt your hair's natural ability to clean itself, and using more natural products allow you to wash it less without it feeling dirty. A minimalist feature is that you don't need to bring shampoo if you travel for less than a week.</p>

        <h3 class="primary">Drugs Zero</h3>
        <p>I don't smoke cigarettes or cannabis, and don't take any recreational or harder drug. I drink alcohol when hanging out with friends, but don't get drunk like I used to do in high school or university. The reason for this is both avoiding wasted hangover days, and keeping my liver in good condition.</p>
